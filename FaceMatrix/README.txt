+The directory 'eyedetect' includes the source code about detecting the open eyes on a picture. It is based Adaboost, and uses the cascade classifier.

+The directory 'toMaze.mouth' include the core code about detecting the state of mouths. I use my own algorithm which based on LBP characteristics and statistic analysis.

---------------------------------------

+ I open the source, and expect that someone could improve the algorithm about detecting the state of mouse and connect with me. Thank you:)
