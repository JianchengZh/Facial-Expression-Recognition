+The directory 'FaceMatrix' includes the core of Facial Expression Recognition.

+'mazeface' is a demo to check the recognition. If you want to watch the effects, you could put the project 'mazeface' into a tomcat webserver(and put it in folder 'webapps'), and use Chrome29(or later versions) to access
 it. The path is http://localhost:8080/mazeface/gameView.html.
